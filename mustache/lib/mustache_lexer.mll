(* The grammar of partials is very relaxed compared to normal
   identifiers: we want to allow dots anywhere to express relative
   paths such as ../foo (this is consistent with other implementations
   such as the 'mustache' binary provided by the Ruby implementation),
   and in general we don't know what is going to be used, given that
   partials are controlled programmatically.

   We forbid spaces, to ensure that the behavior of trimming spaces
   around the partial name is consistent with the other tag, and we
   forbid newlines and mustaches to avoid simple delimiter mistakes
   ({{> foo } ... {{bar}}) being parsed as valid partial names.

   (Note: if one wishes to interpret partials using lambdas placed
   within the data (foo.bar interpreted as looking up 'foo' then 'bar'
   in the input data and hoping to find a user-decided representation
   of a function, it is of course possible to restrict the valid names
   and split on dots on the user side.) *)

   (* Trim whitespace around standalone tags.

      The Mustache specification is careful with its treatment of
      whitespace. In particular, tags that do not themselves expand to
      visible content are defined as "standalone", with the
      requirement that if one or several standalone tags "stand alone"
      in a line (there is nothing else but whitespace), the whitespace
      of this line should be ommitted.

      For example, this means that:
        {{#foo}}
        I can access {{var}} inside the section.
        {{/foo}
      takes, once rendered, only 1 line instead of 3: the newlines
      after {{#foo}} and {{/foo}} are part of the "standalone
      whitespace", so they are not included in the output.

      Note: if a line contains only whitespace, no standalone tag,
      then the whitespace is preserved.

      We implement this by a post-processing past on the lexer token
      stream.  We split the token stream, one sub-stream per line, and
      then for each token line we determine if satisfies the
      standalone criterion.

      Another information collected at the same time, as it is also
      part of whitespace processing, is the "indentation" of partials:
      if a partial expands to multi-line content, and if it is
      intended at the use-site (it is at a non-zero column with only
      whitespace before it on the line), then the specification
      mandates that all its lines should be indented by the same
      amount.  We collect this information during the whitespace
      postprocessing of tokens, and store it in the Partial
      constructor as the first parameter.
