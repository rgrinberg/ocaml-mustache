(** This test is designed to get a sense of the backward-compatibility impact of
    changes to the ocaml-mustache library.

    mustache_v200.mli is exactly a copy of the Mustache interface as it existed
    in the version v2.0.0, and it should not change.

    mustache_v200.ml is a reimplementation of this interface using the current
    ocaml-mustache library. If the library changes, this reimplementation will
    have to be fixed as well; the invasiveness of this fix can be used to
    estimate the invasiveness of the change for end-users.

    v2.0.0 was chosen because it does not contain an explicit AST definition or
    "fold" function -- whose compatibility breaks for basically any new language
    feature or representation change (for example when adding locations in the
    AST). *)
